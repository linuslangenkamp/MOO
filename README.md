# MOO: Modelica / Model Optimizer

MOO: Modelica / Model Optimizer v0.1.0 is being refactored around a C++ AD
core first. The active AD library currently exposes a small expression API for
scalar and vector expressions, value evaluation, derivatives, Hessian-vector
products, and sparsity. Legacy Python modeling/codegen code has been moved to
`archive/python_legacy/` while the C++ AD foundation is rebuilt.

## Working with this repository

Clone with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:AMIT-HSBI/MOO.git
```

If you already cloned without submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Compilation

MOO uses CMake to compile.

### Dependencies

Install with your favorite package manager

#### Required

- C Compiler

- C++ Compiler

- Fortran Compiler

- LAPACK

  - Debian / Ubuntu: `apt install liblapack-dev`
  - Latest OpenBLAS build from source: add `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LAPACK=OFF -DDOWNLOAD_LAPACK=ON` to the CMake configure command

#### Optional

- METIS

  - Debian / Ubuntu `apt install libmetis-dev`
  - if METIS is not available: add `-DMUMPS_HAS_METIS=OFF` to the CMake configure command

- HSL

  - add `-DIPOPT_HAS_HSL` to the CMake configure command (package should be found via PkgConfig)

- FMI support through the in-repository `third-party/fmi4c` submodule

### Configure

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install
```

Possible configuration arguments:

- `MOO_WITH_UNO`: Build Uno solver support (default: `ON`)
- `MOO_WITH_RADAU`: Build with RADAU fortran code to perform simulations (default: `ON`)
- `MOO_WITH_C_INTERFACE`: Build C interfaces used by generated problems (default: `ON`)
- `MOO_WITH_FMI_INTERFACE`: Build FMI interface support with fmi4c (default: `ON`)
- `MOO_TESTS`: Build tests (default: `ON`)

### Build

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel <Nr. of cores> --target all
```

## Python Frontend

The Python package and Python examples are not active during the C++ AD
refactor. Legacy files are archived under `archive/python_legacy/` for later
inspection.

## Native AD

MOO AD lives in `src/ad`. The active public C++ modeling handles are `ad::Expr`
and `ad::Vec`; C++ users include `ad.h` and link `mooad`. The first clean slice
supports scalar/vector value evaluation, symbolic derivative transforms, and
structural sparsity. Derivatives are constructed as expression graphs first:
`derivative`, `gradient_expr`, `jvp_expr`, `vjp_expr`, and `hvp_expr` return
`Expr` or `Vec`. HVP is built symbolically as `jvp(vjp(f, x, lambda), x, v)`.

### Test

Add `-DMOO_TESTS=ON` to the CMake configure command.
After building run the tests:

```bash
cmake --build build --target test
```

### Development

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test the GitHub workflows locally:

```bash
act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:full-latest --artifact-server-path $PWD/.artifacts
```


# Features and Functionality

## General Dynamic Optimization Problem (GDOP)

### Free Initial or Final Time
The most generic problem directly implemented in MOO is a General Dynamic Optimization Problem (GDOP) with free control variables $u(t)$, free static parameters
$p$, free initial time $t_0$ and free final time $t_f$ of the form:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{u(t), p, t_0, t_f}\quad
& M(x_0, u_0, x_f, u_f, p, t_0, t_f)
+ \int_{t_0}^{t_f} L\bigl(x(t), u(t), p\bigr)\, dt \\[6pt]
\text{s.t.}\quad
& \frac{dx}{dt} = f\bigl(x(t), u(t), p\bigr), \quad t \in [t_0, t_f], \\[4pt]
& g^L \le g\bigl(x(t), u(t), p\bigr) \le g^U,
\quad t \in [t_0, t_f], \\[4pt]
& r^L \le r\bigl(x_0, u_0, x_f, u_f, p, t_0, t_f\bigr) \le r^U, \\[4pt]
& x^L \le x(t) \le x^U,\quad
  u^L \le u(t) \le u^U,\quad
  t \in [t_0, t_f], \\[4pt]
& p^L \le p \le p^U,\quad
  t_0^L \le t_0 \le t_0^U,\quad
  t_f^L \le t_f \le t_f^U.
\end{aligned}
```

### Fixed Initial and Final Time

If the problem is given on a fixed time horizon $[t_0, t_f]$, the library can also solve problems of the form:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{u(t), p}\quad
& M(x_0, u_0, x_f, u_f, p)
+ \int_{t_0}^{t_f} L\bigl(x(t), u(t), p, t\bigr)\, dt \\[6pt]
\text{s.t.}\quad
& \frac{dx}{dt} = f\bigl(x(t), u(t), p, t\bigr),
\quad t \in [t_0, t_f], \\[4pt]
& g^L \le g\bigl(x(t), u(t), p, t\bigr) \le g^U,
\quad t \in [t_0, t_f], \\[4pt]
& r^L \le r\bigl(x_0, u_0, x_f, u_f, p\bigr) \le r^U, \\[4pt]
& x^L \le x(t) \le x^U,\quad
  u^L \le u(t) \le u^U,\quad
  t \in [t_0, t_f], \\[4pt]
& p^L \le p \le p^U.
\end{aligned}
```

In this version, the user is also allowed to use the provided time variable $t$ in the functions $L, f, g$.

### Direct Collocation Transcription

GDOPs are transcribed to a finite-dimensional NLP by direct
collocation. MOO uses flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation, where the
continuous state and control trajectories are represented at each collocation
node, while static parameters and optional free times are represented once
globally. The resulting NLP contains the collocated dynamics, path constraints,
boundary constraints, variable bounds and the discretized Mayer/Lagrange
objective.

The user-facing problem is implemented as a `GDOP::Problem` class. It provides
the dimensions, bounds, initial guesses and callback functions for objective
terms, dynamics, path constraints, boundary constraints and their derivatives.
MOO then assembles the sparse NLP structure, applies scaling, maps solver
variables back to trajectories and exposes the final primal-dual trajectory,
i.e. primal optimal solution / states, controls and parameters as well as
continuous duals / costate estimations after optimization.

One central capability of the GDOP is the pluggable strategy concept. Users can use the
default strategies or provide custom ones, for example for
initialization or adaptive mesh refinement; see `src/nlp/instances/gdop/strategies.h` and
`src/nlp/instances/gdop/strategies.cpp`. These strategies are coordinated by
the GDOP orchestrator in `src/nlp/instances/gdop/orchestrator.cpp`, allowing
solver workflows to be extended without changing the continuous problem
definition. Adaptive mesh refinement for this collocation-based workflow is
discussed in "Enhancing Collocation-Based Dynamic Optimization through Adaptive
Mesh Refinement", Linus Langenkamp and Bernhard Bachmann, 16th International
Modelica & FMI Conference, 2025, DOI: 10.3384/ecp218127.

More detailed API documentation for implementing GDOPs is in
`reference/gdop.md`. Python modeling examples are in `examples/moo/hello.py`,
`examples/moo/representative.py`, `examples/moo/free_time.py`, and
`examples/moo/free_time_boundary.py`.

## Consistent Initialization of DAEs

MOO also provides an `Init` NLP instance for consistent initialization of
differential-algebraic equation systems. The problem starts from an initial
state and parameter guess `(y, p0)` and solves for state values `y` and
parameter corrections, with callbacks evaluated at the corrected parameters
defined below:

```math
p = p_0 + \Delta p
```

```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_{y, \Delta p}\quad
& J(y, p) \\[4pt]
\text{s.t.}\quad
& F(y, p) = 0, \\[2pt]
& g^L \le G(y, p) \le g^U, \\[2pt]
& y^L \le y \le y^U,\quad
  p^L \le p \le p^U,\quad
  \Delta p^L \le \Delta p \le \Delta p^U.
\end{aligned}
```

The objective can be user-defined, zero for pure feasibility, or the built-in
least-squares parameter correction

```math
\sum_i \left(\frac{\Delta p_i}{p_{\mathrm{nominal},i}}\right)^2
```

This makes initialization usable both as a
standard feasibility problem and as a parameter-correction
problem when the original DAE initialization is inconsistent.

The implementation lives in `src/nlp/instances/init/`. Small objective and
Hessian checks are in `test/init/`, and `test/init/init_benchmark.cpp` contains
a scalable synthetic chemical-equilibrium initialization benchmark.

More detailed API documentation for implementing the native C++ `Init` backend
is in `reference/init.md`. The Python frontend currently focuses on GDOP and
standard NLP models.

## Standard NLP

MOO also provides a generated standard NLP interface for problems of the form:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\min_x\quad & f(x) \\
\text{s.t.}\quad & g^L \le g(x) \le g^U, \\
& x^L \le x \le x^U.
\end{aligned}
```

The Python frontend exposes this as `nlp_model(...)` and generates exact AD
callbacks for objective values, gradients, constraints, Jacobians, and
Lagrangian Hessians. See `reference/nlp.md` and `examples/moo/nlp_qp.py`.
